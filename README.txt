Hello,

The following is a series of Graphics Programming demos done over the summer of 2015.

These demos do require a Gamepad (preferably an XBOX 360 controller) to cycle through.

The controls are as follow (on an XBOX 306 pad) across all demos:

Left/Right Should Bumpers: 	Cycle through demos

Left Joystick click:		Toggle between camera control mode and standard control (default)

Camera Control on:
Left Joystick:			Move in xy-plane
Right Joystick click:		Toggle between rotation and moving in z-plane
Right Joystick:			Rotate / Move in z-plane 

Most demos have varying commands for the face buttons, the d-pad, as well as Back and start, so play around!


When compiling, NuGet packages will need to be restored in the Solution folder.

This project may see some updates in the future.

As always, send any inquiries to:
